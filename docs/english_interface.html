<p class="p1">MyBox: Set of Easy Tools</p>
<p class="paragraph">This is GUI program based on JavaFx to provide simple and easy functions. It's free and open sources</p>

<p class="p3">Download</p>
<p class="paragraph">Packages of each version have been uploaded at Release directory now. You can find them by clicking 
<a href="https://github.com/Mararsh/MyBox/releases" target=_Blank> "releases"</a> tab in main page of this project. </p>
<p class="paragraph">EXE package <a href="https://github.com/Mararsh/MyBox/releases/download/v5.2/MyBox-5.2-exe.zip"> MyBox-5.2-exe.zip</a> is avaliable for users who have not java env. It need not installation and users can run the EXE directly after unpack it. (Please unpack it under path with pure-English name.)</p>
<p class="paragraph">Since Java is installed by default in Linux env and Mac env, the installation images are not made for the 2 platfroms. User can download jar file if JRE or JDK 8/9/10 is installed: <a href="https://github.com/Mararsh/MyBox/releases/download/v5.2/MyBox-5.2-jar.zip"> MyBox-5.2-jar.zip</a></p>

<p class="p3">Launch</p>
<p class="paragraph">Double click "MyBox.exe" to launch MyBox on Windows. The default "Open Method" of image/text/PDF files can be associated to MyBox.exe and a file can be opened directly by MyBox by double clicking the file's name.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Run following command to launch this program with Jar package:</p>
<pre><code>                   java   -jar   MyBox-5.2.jar</code></pre>
<p class="paragraph">A file path can follow the command as argument to be opened directly by MyBox. Example, following command will open the image:</p>
<pre><code>                   java   -jar   MyBox-5.2.jar  /tmp/a1.jpg</code></pre>

<p class="p3">Limitation</p>
<p class="paragraph">MyBox.exe can not be lanuched under path including non-English characters.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Java 11 has changed a lot, so MyBox may not work on Java env higher than 10. 
This is the last version based on Java 8 and later versions will be based on Java 12.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The embedded Derby is in single-application mode, so only one instance of MyBox can read/write db. 
That is, multiple instances of MyBox can run at same time but only the first one can save and visit configuration data while others can do most things except for accessing user's data.</p>

<p class="p1" >Current Version</p>
<p class="paragraph">Current version is 5.2. Its features are mentioned below in summary.</p>
<p class="p2" >Cross-platform</p>
<p class="paragraph">MyBox is implemented in pure Java and based on open source codes, so it can run any platform which supports Java 8/9/10.</p>
